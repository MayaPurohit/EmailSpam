    "In the confusion matrix, we can see that the false positive (type I error) is much more common than a type II error (false negative). This means that emails that are actually ham will get classified as spam more often than emails that are spam getting misclassified as ham emails. 5.7% of spam emails were misclassified as ham emails while 15% of ham emails were misclassified as spam emails. Therefore, type I errors are more likely, according to the confusion matrix above. The numbers on the main diagonal are the largest, indicating that most of the emails in the test files were classified as the correct type by the classifier. 5848/6525 (89.6%) of the emails in the test set were classified correctly by the Naive Bayes classifier."

    "**Answer 9:** I did not reduce the size of the test set when computing the accuracy. I got an accuracy of 91.7% for the KNN classifier when the number of neighbors was set to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 10:** The KNN classifier is more accurate at determining the class of an email. Unlike the Naive Bayes Classifier, a type II error is more likely to occur with the KNN classifier, meaning that a spam email is more likely to be misclassified as a ham email than the other way around. There are more false negative emails (12.1% of spam emails were misclassified), than false positive emails (4.4% of ham emails were misclassified). The accuracy of the classifier is around 92%, which is higher than the Naive Bayes Classifier, which had an accuracy around 89.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 11:** One positive aspect of using KNN is that the training process of very fast and efficient because we are simply memorizing the training data for use. The exemplars and the classes are identical to the training set data and classes. Since the Naive Bayes classifier finds the likelihood of each word being in a spam or ham email, the training process for Naive Bayes is much more expensive and will be less efficient. A con of KNN is that we have to compute the distance of each sample in the training set from the test sample, which makes prediction computations expensive for large datasets, like the email dataset. Getting predictions from the KNN classifier took significantly longer than getting predictions from the Naive Bayes Classifier. It is much easier to make predictions with the Naive Bayes Classifier because we only have to perform matrix computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 12:** When potentially reducing the training set or test set, we want to make sure that the samples are shuffled so that the classifier is trained on both types of emails. If the training set was organized so that all of the ham emails were first and all of the spam emails were after the ham emails, reducing the training set could mean that we lose all of the spam emails. This means that the classifier could be trained without any spam emails, making it ineffective at classifying emails as spam. Our classifier would be very biased if it was only trained with one type of email. Additionally, if the test set was not shuffled and it was organized with all of one type of email at the beginning of the dataset, when reducing the size of the test set, we could reduce it to a point where only one type of email is seen in the test set. When trying to determining the accuracy of the classifier, we would get an inaccurate value because only one type of email was used to test the classifier. Therefore, it is important to shuffle the dataset to ensure that emails of multiple classes are included in the training and the testing process. "

    "I hypothesized that removing common stop words from the top_words and the feature vectors would significantly increase the accuracy of the classifiers because the stop words do not have much of a correlation with the classification of an email. Words such as \"the\" and \"it\" will show up in both spam and ham emails because they are very common words. They are not good indicators of whether an email is spam or ham because they are universal words. I believed that removing these words would make more room for words that would help a classifier differentiate between a spam and a ham email in the top_words list. When there are more specific words that the classifier can look at to make its predictions, the accuracy will be higher because the classifier has a better idea of what a spam and ham email is.\n",

    "When comparing the values of accuracy for the classifiers when we didn't remove certain stop words as opposed to when we did for both KNN and Naive Bayes, we can see that there is not much change in accuracy. The KNN classifier accuracy increased from 91.7% to 92.4% when we removed the stop words and the Naive Bayes classifier accuracy decreased from 89.6% to 89.4%. This counters my hypothesis because the accuracy did not change significantly when we removed common stop words and the accuracy for the Naive Bayes classifier actually decreased. This may be due to the fact that I only removed a small number of stop words, meaning that the impact would not be significant enough to change the accuracy drastically. I may need to remove more stop words to change the accuracy. Additionally, the accuracy may have gone down for the Naive Bayes Classifier because the stop words are more indicative of an email being spam or ham than I had predicted in my hypothesis. Spam emails may have more instances of a stop word than a ham email, which can be used by the classifier to make an accurate prediction. "

    "Above, I have displayed the words present in a small number of emails that were misclassified as spam when they were ham (false positive) or misclassified as ham when they were spam (false negative). To do this, I found the feature vector of each email and searched to see which of the top_words were present in the email. I then printed these words out to see if there was a general trend in the emails that were misclassified by the Naive Bayes classifier. Emails that were deemed spam when they were ham tend to ask for the reader to visit a website to perform some action (indicated by the \"http\"), which is generally a suspicious activity. Therefore, it makes sense why these emails were classified as spam. Emails that were spam that were classified as ham do not have many of the top words in them and are typically shorter than emails that were misclassified as spam emails. This means that emails that don't include as many of the top words tend to be classified as ham even when they are spam. Most of the emails that were in the false negative category do not have any suspicious language in them, making it reasonable for them to be classified as ham. "

Here is an example workflow:\n",

    "KNN can also be used to perform regression between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. The potential advantage of this approach is that the regression performed by KNN does not assume any specific form of the regression curve (e.g. line, polynomial, etc.) â€” the regression is entirely training data-dependent.\n",
